# Twitter-DAPP

## Project Overview
The Twitter-DAPP (Decentralized Application) is a web3 social media platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project aims to create a decentralized alternative to the traditional centralized social media platforms, providing users with more control over their data and interactions.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Twitter-like Platform**: The DAPP allows users to post tweets, follow other users, and engage with content in a decentralized manner.
- **Blockchain-based Data Storage**: All user data, including posts, profiles, and interactions, is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring data ownership and transparency.
- **Tokenized Incentive System**: The DAPP utilizes a native cryptocurrency token to incentivize user engagement, content creation, and platform governance.
- **Decentralized Moderation**: The platform employs a decentralized moderation system, where the community collectively decides on content and user moderation, rather than a centralized authority.
- **Interoperability**: The DAPP is designed to be interoperable with other web3 applications and platforms, enabling seamless integration and cross-platform functionality.
- **Ease of use**: The DAPP integrates with the MetaMask API to allow users to easily connect their wallets.

## Key Functions
### Create User Profile
- Users can create their own profiles on the DAPP, which include their username, profile picture, and a brief bio.
- User profiles are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring data ownership and transparency.
  
### Create Tweet:
- Registered users can create and post tweets on the DAPP.
- Tweets are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and are accessible to all users.
### Like/Unlike Tweets:
- Registered users can like or unlike tweets posted by other users.
- The number of likes for each tweet is recorded on the blockchain and is publicly visible.
  
### Get Total Likes:
- Users can view the total number of likes a specific tweet has received.
- This information is retrieved directly from the Ethereum blockchain.

## Technical Overview
The Twitter-DAPP is built using the following technologies:
- **Solidity**: The smart contracts that power the DAPP's core functionality are written in Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum-based applications.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: The DAPP is built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its decentralized infrastructure and native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).
- **React.js**: The front-end of the DAPP is built using the React.js library, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Web3.js**: The DAPP integrates the Web3.js library to facilitate communication between the front-end and the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS (Interplanetary File System)**: The DAPP utilizes IPFS for decentralized data storage, ensuring the immutability and availability of user-generated content.
